I'm passionate about Linux, containers, InfoSec, electronics, and all things tech! With over 14 years of experience in IT infrastructure and automation, I've worked across diverse technology domains. Beyond the tech world, I enjoy traveling, reading, music, and spending quality time with family and friends.

I specialize in Cloud Infrastructure, DevOps, container orchestration, and security automation. Here you'll find thoughts, project breakdowns, and practical solutions I've discovered along the way. I believe in learning by doing and sharing the journey—documenting both successes and failures along the way. I'm a strong advocate for open-source and knowledge sharing.

This is my space to share thoughts, news, and projects about technology and computing in the [blog section](/blog). I collect useful snippets and tricks [here](blog/2026/02/04_paste-this-snippet/) - suggestions are welcome!
