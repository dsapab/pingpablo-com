I am passionate about Linux, Containers, InfoSec, electronics... and any tech! I have 10+ years experience in IT Infrastructure and automation, working across diverse technology domains. Besides all the nerd stuff, I also enjoy traveling, music and spending quality time with family and friends.

This is my space where I will share thoughts, news and projects about technology and computers in the [blog section](/blog). I collect all my useful snippets & tricks [here](https://github.com/dsapab/wizardly-snippets), suggestions are welcome!
