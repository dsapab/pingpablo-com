Hello there!

I maintain a collection of [code snippets](https://github.com/dsapab/wizardly-snippets/tree/main) that have proven useful on many occasions. Even with the rise of AI agents and coding assistants, it's always a good idea to have your own well-tested and reliable toolbox. These snippets can also be created with AI or used as template starting points for improving them with agents.

The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) as well: https://dsapab.github.io/wizardly-snippets. I'm embedding it here so it can be dynamically referenced and always remains up-to-date!

P.
