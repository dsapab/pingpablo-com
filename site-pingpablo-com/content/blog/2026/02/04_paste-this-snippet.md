Hello there!

I am maintaining a collection of [code snippets](https://github.com/dsapab/wizardly-snippets/tree/main) that proved to be useful in many occasions. Even with the rase of AI agents.

It is being hosted on [GitHub pages](https://dsapab.github.io/wizardly-snippets/#license) as well. I am embedding it here so I can dynamically reference it and remains always up-to-date!

P.
