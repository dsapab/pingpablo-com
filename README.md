Welcome to my personal site, where you will find content about IT, Linux, Info Sec, Networking and Cloud computing. I will try to share what I have learned during my journey, playing around with computers. I may not post very often, but I want to crate a space for myself and for anyone that finds tech stuff content useful and enjoyable. I will document my projects and the tools that I daily use, sharing my view on how and why I use them.
